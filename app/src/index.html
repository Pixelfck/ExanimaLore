As with most our myths it differs depending on whom you ask, the <a href="#The_Guardian_of_the_Underworld">Guardian's</a> role in particular is an ambivalent one. There is fear of what he represents and of his dark and dangerous realm but there is also a feeling of deference and a belief that he will watch over our loved ones once they pass away. We inter our dead to consign them to the <a href="#The_Guardian_of_the_Underworld">Guardian's</a> care and we believe that he will grant them a life beyond this one. Behind the intimidating titles and malicious curses the <a href="#The_Guardian_of_the_Underworld">Guardian</a> is also a giver of life. He is said to restore life to those that have fallen in his service, or that some become beholden to him owing to their resurrection. Perhaps the most notable myth is that in a time of dire need the <a href="#The_Guardian_of_the_Underworld">Guardian</a> will raise an army of those given into his care to defend us.

		<td><p>A book that introduces many concepts on the working of the thaumaturgic mind and presents various notions that seem at times in conflict and of little substance. Your impression is that the author was well informed, but did not truly understand what was divulged.</p><p>Thaumaturges are known to dwell in lonely towers and other remote residences. A common misconception is that it is to conduct their strange work away from prying eyes, but the truth is less sinister and less obvious. The mind of a thaumaturge is an intangible thing that extends far beyond their physical presence, it is as a great tree of connections to the world around them. When the lesser minds of multitudes move through this time and time again, they slowly chip away at its branches, weakening the thaumaturge as they do so. This is why they withdraw from company and seek isolation, so that their power is not drained away.</p><p>A notable exception to this are the great healers, they who live selflessly among those which they might lend aid. The uncomfortable substance of their success is that as they care for those whom from illness pass to death, they form a bond, and from that bond, in the moment of passing, they take something to sustain them. This is little known and little discussed, as it could be seen in the wrong light and cast suspicion on these devoted servants of the community.</p></td>

The minds of two thaumaturges can become highly attuned and learn to live and work in harmony. In unison they can be stronger, and when the time comes for the mentor to leave this world behind, their mind will not simply dissipate and be lost entirely, but continue to live in part through their apprentice. Thaumaturges consider their power a great gift that must not be lost, but passed on, treasured and nurtured.</p><p>The tradition of apprenticeship in <a href="#The_Order_of_Thaumaturges">the Order of Thaumaturges</a> does not only concern the preservation of knowledge and power, but serves also to temper and check the spirits of those who would wield it. It is not only aptitude that is passed on, but the wisdom and temperament of the master. It is not unheard of that apprentices were ultimately deemed to be unfit for such talents and their apprenticeship abandoned.</p><p>It appears a final chapter was removed from this book, and in its place there is a brief warning against the dangers of bonds formed with beasts, of how these corrupt the mind of a thaumaturge, reducing them to savage beasts themselves.</p></td>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="dialogue-pc">Player</span> It's complicated, but the outcome is that to function, the portal must exist in different realities. It causes them to
						converge, just for an instant, just the tiniest part. Through a big but brief series of these convergences, things come to
						be
						elsewhere.
					<ul>
						<li><span class="dialogue-npc">Derrin</span> That just sounds like nonsense.
							<ul>

									<a href="#dialogue008d" class="dialogue-next"></a></li>
								<li><span class="dialogue-pc">Player</span> There's even a version in which we travel into all of these different realities, but as we're only aware of one,
										we're none the wiser. <a href="#dialogue008d" class="dialogue-next"></a>
